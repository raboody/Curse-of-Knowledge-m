# action_space.py â€“ Generates the action space (e.g., list of all possible actions given a set of blocks)

# action_spaceTESTER.py - action_space tester


# HypothesisGenerators.py: all 5 hypothesis generators (Ordered AND, ordered AND && OR, Unordered AND, Unordered OR, Unordered AND && OR)

# HypothesisGeneratorTESTER.py: tests to see if hypothesis generators are working as planned


# GetOutcome.py: given the "rule" that activates the machine & a series of actions, returns whether the machine is "ON" or "OFF" for                       each action

# GetOutcomeTESTER1.py: Tests the generator with 1 True Hypothesis and 1 action

# GetOutcomeTESTER2.py: Tests the generator with a hypothesis space & action space of arbitrary size. The function assumes that each hypothesis provided is the "TrueHypothesis" in turn (that is, goes through all actions with a TrueHypothesis if [], of ['A', 'ANDOR'], etc.)

# GetoutcomeTESTER3_csv.py: Takes what is basically the output of GetOutcomeTESTER2, but stores it in GetOutcome.csv for easier review.


# ValueFunction.py - Figures out how many hypotheses an action would delete, given the true hypothesis. Sums up the number of hypotheses it deletes to produce an "action value" 

# ValueFunctionTESTER.py - tests the ValueFunction given an action, a true hypothesis, and a hypothesis space

# ValueFunctionTESTER2_csv.py - outputs ValueFunction to a csv (includes the true hypothesis, current hypothesis, current action, expected outcome, and the actual outcome)


# CompleteActionSpaceValue.py - Uses the Action Value Generator to generate action values for not just 1 action, but a series of actions                        (e.g., what we'd actually see from teacher data)

# CopmleteActionSpaceValueTESTER.py - Tests the Action Value Generator




# OutcomeGeneratorTESTER1: One way to test the outcome generator

# OutcomeGeneratorTESTER2: More comprehensive (but computationally costly) way to test the outcome generator
